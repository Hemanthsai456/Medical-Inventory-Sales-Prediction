# 💊 Medical Inventory Sales Prediction & Segmentation

## 📌 Project Overview

Medical inventory management is a critical business function that directly impacts product availability, operational efficiency, and profitability. Poor inventory planning can lead to overstocking, increased holding costs, product expiration, and lost sales opportunities.

This project leverages Machine Learning and Data Analytics techniques to predict medical inventory sales and identify inventory patterns that support better business decision-making.

The project combines:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning
* Feature Importance Analysis
* Explainable AI (SHAP)
* K-Means Inventory Segmentation
* Interactive Streamlit Dashboard

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Medical stores often face challenges in balancing inventory levels with customer demand.

### Business Challenges

* Overstocking increases inventory carrying costs.
* Understocking results in missed sales opportunities.
* Demand patterns are difficult to estimate manually.
* Inventory behavior varies across products and suppliers.

### Project Objectives

* Predict total sales (`SaleTot`)
* Identify key drivers of sales performance
* Segment products based on inventory characteristics
* Support inventory optimization and forecasting

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset consists of real-world medical inventory records collected from operational inventory management systems.

### Note

Due to confidentiality requirements, the original dataset cannot be publicly shared.

The repository contains the complete analysis workflow, machine learning models, visualizations, and deployment code without exposing sensitive business information.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA was performed to understand inventory behavior and uncover business insights.

### Key Analyses

* Fast Moving Products
* High Turnover Companies
* Inventory Hoarding Analysis
* Purchase vs Sales Analysis
* Stock vs Sales Analysis
* Overstocked Product Identification

### Business Insights

* Fast-moving products were identified for replenishment planning.

## 🏆 Final Model Performance

### Selected Model

**Gradient Boosting Regressor**

| Metric   | Value  |
| -------- | ------ |
| R² Score | 0.7978 |
| RMSE     | 9.692  |
| MAE      | 4.415  |

### Why Gradient Boosting?

* Highest R² Score
* Lowest RMSE
* Lowest MAE
* Strong Generalization Performance
* Consistent Prediction Accuracy

---

## 📌 Feature Importance Analysis

Feature importance analysis was performed using the final tuned Gradient Boosting model.

### Top Predictive Features

1. OStk (Opening Stock)
2. PurTot (Purchase Total)
3. QohValue (Inventory Value)
4. Packing
5. Product Type Features

These variables contributed the majority of the predictive power used for sales forecasting.

## 🧠 Explainable AI (SHAP)

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to interpret model behavior and increase prediction transparency.

### Implemented Visualizations

* SHAP Summary Plot
* SHAP Waterfall Plot

### Benefits

* Global feature importance understanding
* Individual prediction explanations
* Improved model interpretability
* Increased stakeholder trust

---

## 📦 Inventory Segmentation

K-Means Clustering was applied to segment products based on inventory characteristics.

### Cluster Profiles

#### Cluster 0 – Low-Demand Products

* Low sales volume
* Slow inventory turnover

#### Cluster 1 – Fast-Moving Products

* High sales volume
* Frequent stock movement

#### Cluster 2 – High-Value Products

* High inventory value
* Requires careful monitoring

#### Cluster 3 – Bulk & Moderate-Demand Products

* Moderate demand
* Larger inventory quantities

### Business Value

* Inventory Optimization
* Demand Forecasting
* Stock Planning
* Resource Allocation
