## 🎯 Problem Statement

Medical inventory management is a critical operational challenge where inaccurate forecasting can directly impact product availability, inventory costs, and business performance.

Organizations frequently struggle to maintain optimal inventory levels due to fluctuating demand patterns and procurement uncertainty.

### Business Challenges

* Understocking leads to missed sales opportunities and customer dissatisfaction.
* Demand forecasting is difficult using manual estimation techniques.
* Inventory behavior varies significantly across products and suppliers.
* Inventory managers often lack visibility into demand drivers and stock risks.

### Project Objectives

* Predict total sales (`SaleTot`) using machine learning.
* Identify the most influential inventory variables affecting demand.
* Explain model predictions using SHAP Explainable AI.
* Categorize products into inventory segments using clustering.
* Support inventory planning through actionable business recommendations.

### Most Influential Features

1. OStk (Opening Stock)
2. PurTot (Purchase Total)
3. QohValue (Inventory Value)
4. Packing
5. Product Type Features

### Key Findings

* Inventory-related variables contributed the majority of predictive power.
* Opening Stock emerged as the strongest sales predictor.
* Purchase Quantity significantly influenced demand forecasts.
* Product category information provided additional predictive value.
* Inventory behavior was a stronger predictor than product classification alone.

These findings helped validate the model's learning behavior and business relevance.

### Explainability Objectives

* Understand global model behavior.
* Explain individual predictions.
* Identify the strongest demand drivers.
* Improve stakeholder trust in forecasts.

### Key Insights

* Opening Stock (OStk) is the strongest predictor of future sales.
* Purchase Quantity (PurTot) significantly influences forecasting behavior.
* Inventory-related variables dominate model decisions.
* Product-type variables provide secondary predictive influence.

### Business Value

Explainability enables inventory managers to understand why forecasts are generated and which operational factors drive predicted demand.

## 📦 Inventory Segmentation

K-Means Clustering was applied to identify groups of products with similar inventory and sales characteristics.

This unsupervised machine learning approach enables inventory managers to better understand inventory behavior and develop targeted inventory strategies.

### Cluster Profiles

#### Cluster 0 – Low-Demand Products

* Low sales volume
* Slow inventory turnover
* Lower replenishment priority
* Requires periodic monitoring

#### Cluster 1 – Fast-Moving Products

* High sales volume
* Frequent stock movement
* Strong customer demand
* High replenishment priority

#### Cluster 2 – High-Value Products

* High inventory value
* Significant financial exposure
* Requires careful inventory monitoring
* Important for inventory optimization

#### Cluster 3 – Bulk & Moderate-Demand Products

* Moderate sales demand
* Larger inventory quantities
* Supports routine inventory operations
* Occasional high-volume transactions

### Business Value

* Inventory Optimization
* Demand Forecasting Support
* Better Stock Planning
* Resource Allocation
* Inventory Risk Reduction
* Segment-Based Inventory Strategies

The clustering process successfully identified four distinct inventory groups, enabling more targeted inventory management decisions.
