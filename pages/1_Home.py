### Project Overview

Medical Inventory Forecasting & Decision Support System is an end-to-end Machine Learning application designed to forecast medical inventory sales and support inventory management decisions.

The project combines predictive analytics, interactive dashboards, explainable AI, and inventory segmentation to transform raw inventory data into actionable business insights.

### Problem Statement

Medical inventory management is challenging due to demand uncertainty, overstocking risks, and stockout situations.

- Overstocking increases inventory carrying costs.
- Understocking can lead to missed sales opportunities.
- Manual forecasting often lacks accuracy and consistency.

This project uses historical inventory and procurement data to predict future sales demand and support data-driven inventory planning.
